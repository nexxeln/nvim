## Overview

This is my Neovim config. It's very minimal and fast.

## Installation

Make sure to backup your current config. Then clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nexxeln/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

This will also install Packer automatically. Now just open Neovim and run `:PackerSync`.

```sh
nvim +PackerSync
```
