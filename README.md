> **Warning** <br />
> I no longer have time to maintain this configuration due to various exams and college applications. I might redo my config in June/July 2023 but don't take my word for it. For now I'll be using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Overview

This is my Neovim config. It's very minimal and fast.

## Installation

This config should work on Neovim 0.7+ but I have only tested it in the nightly version.

Make sure to backup your current config. Then clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nexxeln/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

This will also install Packer automatically. Now just open Neovim and run `:PackerSync`.

```sh
nvim +PackerSync
```
